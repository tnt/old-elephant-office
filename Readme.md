old-elephant-office
===================

This was my first Rails project begun in and in my personal use since 2009, originally based on Rails 2.2.

It is written quiet badly, has some serious flaws, no tests and was hardly refactorable or upgradeable to a current Rails, incomplete i18n...

Purpose/Features
---------------

Get rid of MS-Word/OpenOffice for my regular correspondence. It has a very primitive document model (based on table-rows) called *paper* which gets rendered to pdf, memos with stackoverflow-style markdown preview, *external* documents (arbitrary files).
